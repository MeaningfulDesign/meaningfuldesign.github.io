## Organizers


**Alice C. Haynes** is a postdoctoral researcher focusing on actuated textiles and wearables in the Human Computer  
Interaction Lab at Saarland University, Germany. Her research explores ways in which technology can mediate  
meaningful connections, both with our selves and with others, to promote well-being. She is particularly interested in  
incorporating bodily senses of touch and breath into her work, motivated by their innate influence on our physical,  
physiological, and emotional bodies.

  
[**Courtney N. Reed**](http://courtneynreed.com) is a musician and postdoctoral researcher in the Sensorimotor Interaction Group at the Max  
Planck Institute for Informatics. Her work explores the dynamics of agency and control between human and body  
through studying vocal performance. Her current projects involve biosignal-based wearables for augmented performance  
and communication between bodies. She is also interested in first-person methodologies and micro-phenomenology.

  
**Charlotte Nordmoen** is a designer, craftsperson, and PhD candidate in the Augmented Instruments Lab at Queen  
Mary University of London. Her background in textiles and materials craft shapes her research in materiality and in  
how technology shapes and affects our lives. Charlotte is curious about the impact of design, sensing technology, and  
artificial intelligence on the creative disciplines and what it means to be human in a digital age.

  
**Sophie Skatch** is a fashion designer and postdoctoral researcher in the Centre for Advanced Robotics at Queen Mary  
University of London. Her experience combines fashion, textiles, and tailoring with digital media, wearable technology,  
and behavioural science. Her research investigates how embedded textile sensors can be used in body-centric systems  
to study social interaction through movement and touch interactions. Sophieâ€™s work aims to stimulate discourse about  
the potential of fashion in wearable technology, establishing e-textiles as a new modality for social computing
