Her experience combines fashion, textiles, and tailoring with digital media, wearable technology, and behavioural science. Her research investigates how embedded textile sensors can be used in body-centric systems to study social interaction through movement and touch interactions. Sophie's work aims to stimulate discourse about the potential of fashion in wearable technology, establishing e-textiles as a new modality for social computing.</div></td>
