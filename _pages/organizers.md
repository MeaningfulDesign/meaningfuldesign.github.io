<!-- [**Alice C. Haynes**](https://www.alicehaynes.com/) is a postdoctoral researcher focusing on actuated textiles and wearables in the Human Computer  
Interaction Lab at Saarland University, Germany. Her research explores ways in which technology can mediate  
meaningful connections, both with our selves and with others, to promote well-being. She is particularly interested in  
incorporating bodily senses of touch and breath into her work, motivated by their innate influence on our physical,  
physiological, and emotional bodies.

and behavioural science. Her research investigates how embedded textile sensors can be used in body-centric systems  
to study social interaction through movement and touch interactions. Sophieâ€™s work aims to stimulate discourse about
