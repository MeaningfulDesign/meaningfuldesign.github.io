## About the Studio

[**Find our Studio proposal here**](http://meaningfuldesign.github.io/docs/TEI_23_Studio___Soma_Reflective_Technology.pdf)

A one-size-fits-all design mentality, rooted in objective efficiency, is ubiquitous in our mass-production society. We aim
to counter this mindset through the exploration of relevant technology and topics in TEI and other HCI communities,
including flexible and organic materials, biodata and biofeedback, e-textiles and material discourse, and soft robotics.
These materials are, by nature, adaptable, diverse, and unpredictable, reflecting the plurality of human experiences and
inviting a relational dialogue with the material.

We invite practitioners, designers, and researchers who are already engaged in somaesthetic principles and attention
to individuality, as well as those who are interested in applying these design focuses to their own work. We will
develop design probes with these materials to explore what it means to design for soma-reflective, meaningful relations.
Collectively, we will address plurality and individuality, actively rejecting solutionism and objective efficiency. We aim
to share experiences, experiment with ideas, and initiate on-going collaborations in order to support each other as a
community and become conscious designers of technologies and, therefore, human experience.
